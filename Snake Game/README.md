# Snake Game

The snake game is a very popular and fun game. Every time the snake eats the food, its length grows longer that makes the game more difficult.
The player has to move a snake so it touches the food. If the snake touches itself then the game will be over.

### Project Prerequisites :

To build the Snake game project, I use the Turtle module, Random module, Time module, and Python concepts.
